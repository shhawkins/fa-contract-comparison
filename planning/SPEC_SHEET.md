### üöÄ **READY FOR PHASE 7: Advanced PDF Parsing, Template Features, UI/UX Enhancements & Export Options**
**NEXT PRIORITY**: Implement the final phase of development, focusing on these key areas:
1.  **Advanced Hierarchical PDF Parsing & Structuring:**
    *   **Objective**: Enhance the PDF pre-processing pipeline to accurately parse and structure contracts with multi-level hierarchies (Sections > Capital Letters > Numbers > Lowercase Letters, and Letters of Agreement).
    *   **Outcome**: Produce a more granular and accurately nested JSON output. This will enable more precise data analysis, navigation, and comparison features by reflecting the true hierarchical nature of the contract documents.
2.  **Advanced Template Features & Export Enhancements:**
    *   Implement advanced template features with automated section finding and bulk comparison workflows.
    *   Provide enhanced export options (PDF, structured data) and user account features for persistence.
3.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   **Hierarchical Nesting & Display**: Improve the visual representation and interaction with hierarchically structured content resulting from advanced PDF parsing. Ensure intuitive navigation and clear presentation of nested items.
    *   **General UI Improvements**: Address user feedback for a more polished and user-friendly interface across the application.
    *   **Scrolling Behavior**: Implement frame-specific scrolling for contract displays. Each contract view (Document A, Document B) should scroll independently within its designated frame, preventing the entire webpage from scrolling. This applies to main document views and any embedded or modal views if applicable.

### üõ† **TECHNICAL DEBT & ISSUES TO ADDRESS:**
- **[HIGH PRIORITY] Directory Structure**: Development server requires running from nested `/contract-chatbot/contract-chatbot/` directory. **Investigate and resolve to allow running from the root `contract-chatbot/` directory.** This is crucial for standard development workflows and onboarding.
- **[HIGH PRIORITY] NPM Script "dev"**: The `npm run dev` command is currently missing. **Implement the "dev" script in `package.json`** to start the Next.js development server, likely `next dev`.
- **[HIGH PRIORITY - VERIFY/RE-IMPLEMENT] Frame-Specific Scrolling**: Ensure each contract panel scrolls independently.
- **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Documentation Updates**: File structure section in this document needs updating to reflect the current accurate project structure.
- **Minor**: Some users may experience initial confusion with nested directory structure (related to the high-priority issue above).

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for a TypeScript React (Next.js) application designed to help flight attendants compare their current employment contract with a new contract proposal. The application will provide a responsive layout, chatbot assistance positioned as a "plain English translator," pre-built comparison templates for common scenarios, and tools for saving and sharing comparisons.

**Primary Goal:** To provide flight attendants with a clear, intuitive, and powerful tool to understand how changes in work rules affect their job and life by comparing two complex legal documents, with specialized features that address the unique needs of aviation professionals.

## 2. Core Requirements (MVP)

Based on `goal.md` and user requests, enhanced with flight attendant-specific features:

1.  **Responsive Layout:**
    *   **Desktop/Large Screens (> 1024px):** Two-column layout. Left column displays Document A (e.g., current contract), right column displays Document B (e.g., proposed contract).
    *   **Mobile/Small Screens (<= 1024px):** Two-tab layout. Tab 1 displays Document A, Tab 2 displays Document B.

2.  **Document Display & Pre-processed Data:**
    *   The two core contract documents (current and proposed) are **fixed and will be pre-processed offline from their original PDF format into structured JSON data** (e.g., `contractA.json`, `contractB.json`).
    *   This pre-processing step (performed by developers using robust server-side tools) ensures optimal accuracy, text extraction, and logical structuring (sections, paragraphs, unique IDs).
    *   **Enhanced with domain metadata:** Sections are tagged with aviation-specific categories (scheduling, pay, benefits, work_rules) and importance levels for flight attendants.
    *   The application will load and display content from these pre-processed JSON files.
    *   This approach enhances performance, simplifies client-side logic, and ensures consistent document presentation. The pre-processing pipeline's output will be validated against original PDFs, potentially using automated scripts and manual checks, to ensure high accuracy. Testing will involve varied PDF sources. The display of large documents will be optimized for performance (e.g., through techniques like virtual scrolling or content chunking).

3.  **Chatbot Integration as "Contract Translator":**
    *   A dedicated chat panel/area positioned as a "Plain English Translator" for legal contract language.
    *   Users can query the chatbot regarding the content of both loaded documents, with responses focused on translating complex legal terms into practical implications.
    *   The chatbot is pre-engineered with aviation industry context and flight attendant-specific prompts.
    *   Clear UI messaging emphasizes the chatbot's role as a translation aid, not legal advice.
    *   Users must be able to input and save their own API key (e.g., for OpenAI) to use the chatbot functionality.
    *   The API key should be stored locally in the browser (e.g., `localStorage`) and not on a server for MVP.
    *   The application will provide clear onboarding materials and guidance on API key acquisition, associated costs, usage patterns, and how users can monitor their spending.

4.  **Pre-built Comparison Templates:**
    *   Quick-start templates for common contract comparison scenarios relevant to flight attendants.
    *   Templates include: "Schedule Changes," "Pay Scale Updates," "Benefits Comparison," "Overtime Rules," "Sick Leave Policies," and "Base Assignment Rules."
    *   Each template guides users to relevant contract sections and provides structured comparison workflows.

5.  **Domain-Specific Glossary:**
    *   Integrated glossary of aviation and labor contract terminology.
    *   Contextual tooltips for specialized terms throughout the document display.
    *   Enhanced search functionality that includes glossary terms.
    *   Glossary data available to chatbot for improved context and responses.

6.  **User-Provided API Key:**
    *   Users must be able to input and save their own API key (e.g., for OpenAI) to use the chatbot functionality.
    *   The API key should be stored locally in the browser (e.g., `localStorage`) and not on a server for MVP.

7.  **Save/Share Comparison:**
    *   Ability to select sections/text from both documents.
    *   Generate a shareable output (e.g., an image or structured text/HTML snippet) that includes:
        *   The selected text from Document A.
        *   The selected text from Document B.
        *   A user-provided explanation of the difference/comparison.
    *   This can be achieved by rendering the selection to an off-screen canvas and exporting it as an image (e.g., using `html2canvas`).
    *   Client-side search capability within each loaded document.
    *   Search includes document content and glossary terms.
    *   Search results should be highlighted within the document view.
    *   Category-based filtering (scheduling, pay, benefits, work rules). Search highlighting will be optimized for responsiveness, especially in large documents.

8.  **Enhanced Search Functionality:**
    *   Client-side search capability within each loaded document.
    *   Search includes document content and glossary terms.
    *   Search results should be highlighted within the document view.
    *   Category-based filtering (scheduling, pay, benefits, work rules).

## 3. Secondary Features (Post-MVP)

*   Ability to add/compare other contracts (e.g., other airlines).
*   Advanced text highlighting within documents.
*   Bookmarking specific sections within documents.
*   Note-taking functionality associated with document sections.
*   User accounts (e.g., via Google OAuth) to save API keys, bookmarks, highlights, comparisons, and notes across sessions/devices.
*   Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline access during travel.
*   Evolving the 'Save/Share Comparison' feature into a community knowledge base, allowing users to tag and share insights on specific contract scenarios.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js (using App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Library:** React
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
*   **PDF Handling (Optional/Secondary):** `react-pdf` (wrapper for `pdf.js`) - May be used for an optional feature to view the original PDF documents, but not for primary content display.
*   **State Management:** React Context API (for global state like API key, theme) and local component state. Consider Zustand or Jotai if state complexity increases significantly.
*   **Chatbot API:** Generic integration, assuming a provider like OpenAI. The app will primarily handle the frontend and API key management.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier
*   **Icons:** A suitable icon library (e.g., Heroicons, Lucide React).

**Current Layout Architecture (Phase 6):**
- **Desktop (>1024px)**: `EnhancedResponsiveLayout` with three-panel design:
  - Left: Side-by-side documents (Current + Proposed)
  - Right: Tabbed analysis tools (Diff Analysis, Comparison Tools, AI Chat)
- **Mobile (‚â§1024px)**: Five-tab layout with full functionality maintained
- **Default Focus**: Diff Analysis panel for immediate contract comparison insights

## 6. Component Details (Key Components)

### 6.1. `EnhancedResponsiveLayout.tsx` (updated from `ResponsiveLayout.tsx`)
*   **Responsibility:** Manages the overall layout structure, switching between multi-panel desktop and tabbed mobile views based on screen size. Also manages the collapsed/expanded state of the main Current Contract panel, Proposed Contract panel, and the Analysis Tools sidebar on desktop.
*   **Props:** `documentAContent: ReactNode`, `documentBContent: ReactNode`, `chatPanelContent: ReactNode`, `comparisonToolContent: ReactNode`, `diffVisualizationContent: ReactNode`
*   **Internal Logic:** Uses a media query hook (`useMediaQuery`). Manages state for panel visibility and active tool in the analysis sidebar.

### 6.2. `DocumentViewer.tsx`
*   **Responsibility:** Renders the content of a single pre-processed document (from JSON) with enhanced metadata. Handles search term highlighting, glossary tooltips, text selection, and manages an internal collapsible Document Outline panel. The outline allows navigation, while the main content area displays document sections.
*   **Props:** `document: ProcessedDocumentType`, `searchTerm: string`, `categoryFilter: string[]`, `onSelectText: (selectedText: string, documentId: string, sectionId?: string) => void`, `onNavigateToPdf?: (pageNumber: number) => void`, `className?: string`
*   **Enhanced `ProcessedDocumentType`:** 
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     sections: Array<{
       id: string;
       type: 'heading' | 'paragraph' | 'table' | 'list';
       content: string;
       originalPage?: number;
       metadata: {
         category: 'scheduling' | 'pay' | 'benefits' | 'work_rules' | 'general';
         importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
         glossaryTerms?: string[];
         affects?: string[];
       };
     }>;
   }
   ```
   **Enhanced for Hierarchy (Target for PDF Preprocessing - Phase 2 in `final-plan.md`):**
   The `sections` array will be updated to support a nested structure. Each section object will gain a `children: Array<Section>` property.
   The `type` field in `Section` might also be expanded to include more specific hierarchical types (e.g., "section_header", "list_item_capital", "list_item_numeric").
   ```typescript
   interface HierarchicalSection {
     id: string;
     type: string; // e.g., "section", "loa", "capital_letter_item", "number_item", "lowercase_letter_item", "paragraph_chunk"
     identifier_text: string | null; // e.g., "1", "A", "LOA 1"
     title_text: string | null; // Captured title line
     content_text: string; // Aggregated textual content for this specific node
     page_number_start: number;
     page_number_end: number;
     metadata: { // Existing metadata like category, importance
       category: 'scheduling' | 'pay' | 'benefits' | 'work_rules' | 'general';
       importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
       glossaryTerms?: string[];
       affects?: string[];
     };
     children: HierarchicalSection[]; // Recursive children
   }

   interface ProcessedDocumentType {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     sections: HierarchicalSection[]; // Top-level sections
   }
   ```

*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Manages state for its internal Document Outline collapse.
    *   Renders the `DocumentOutline` component and the main section content area side-by-side (on desktop if outline is visible).
    *   Maps over `document.sections` to render content using `SectionRenderer.tsx` (which in turn uses `HierarchicalSection.tsx` or `LegacySectionRenderer.tsx`).
    *   Highlights `searchTerm` within the displayed `content`.
    *   Filters sections based on `categoryFilter`.
    *   Integrates `GlossaryTooltip.tsx` for specialized terms.
    *   Manages text selection based on the structured content.

### 6.3. `ChatPanel.tsx` (Enhanced as "Contract Translator")
*   **Responsibility:** Provides the UI for chatbot interaction, positioned as a "Plain English Translator" for contract language.
*   **Props:** `documentA: ProcessedDocumentType | null`, `documentB: ProcessedDocumentType | null`, `glossaryData: GlossaryTerm[]`
*   **Internal Logic:** 
    *   Uses `ApiKeyContext` to get the API key.
    *   Uses enhanced `useChatApi` hook with aviation-specific prompt engineering.
    *   Displays clear messaging about the chatbot's role as a translation aid.
    *   Provides suggested queries for common flight attendant concerns.
    *   Incorporates glossary context in chatbot responses.

### 6.4. `ComparisonTemplates.tsx` (New)
*   **Responsibility:** Provides pre-built comparison templates for common flight attendant scenarios.
*   **Props:** `templates: ComparisonTemplate[]`, `onTemplateSelect: (template: ComparisonTemplate) => void`
*   **`ComparisonTemplate` type:**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     description: string;
     category: 'scheduling' | 'pay' | 'benefits' | 'work_rules';
     sections: Array<{
       documentA: string[]; // section IDs to highlight
       documentB: string[]; // section IDs to highlight
     }>;
     guideText: string; // helpful explanation for users
   }
   ```
*   **Internal Logic:** Renders template cards with quick-start buttons for common comparison scenarios.

### 6.5. `GlossaryTooltip.tsx` (New)
*   **Responsibility:** Provides contextual tooltips for aviation and labor contract terms.
*   **Props:** `term: string`, `definition: string`, `children: ReactNode`
*   **Internal Logic:** Detects specialized terms in document content and provides hover/click tooltips with definitions.

### 6.6. `ComparisonTool.tsx` (Enhanced)
*   **Responsibility:** Handles the logic for creating a comparison, enhanced with template support.
*   **Props:** Enhanced to include template state and guidance
*   **Internal Logic:** 
    *   Supports template-guided comparisons.
    *   Collects selected text from both documents.
    *   Provides template-specific guidance and prompts.
    *   Uses utility to generate shareable output.

### 6.X. `HierarchicalSection.tsx` (New or Enhanced Detail)
*   **Responsibility:** Renders a single section that possesses hierarchical metadata (e.g., section, sub-section, item). It applies distinct styling based on the hierarchy level and type. Manages the collapse/expand state of its own textual content, keeping the section header (title, metadata badges) visible. Includes a chevron icon next to the title to toggle content visibility.
*   **Props:** `section: DocumentSection`, `searchTerm?: string`, `onSelectText?: (selectedText: string, sectionId: string) => void`, `onNavigateToPdf?: (pageNumber: number) => void`, `defaultCollapsed?: boolean`
*   **Props (Target for `HierarchicalSection.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    interface HierarchicalSectionProps {
      section: HierarchicalSection; // Using the new nested structure
      searchTerm?: string;
      onSelectText?: (selectedText: string, sectionId: string, pageNumber?: number) => void;
      onNavigateToPdf?: (pageNumber: number) => void;
      defaultCollapsed?: boolean;
      currentHierarchyLevel: number; // To manage styling/indentation
    }
    ```
*   **Internal Logic:** 
    *   Uses `useState` to manage if its content is expanded or collapsed.
    *   Renders section identifier, title, and metadata badges as a persistent header.
    *   Conditionally renders the main textual content (`highlightedContent`) based on its expanded state.
    *   Applies indentation and specific border/background styling based on `section.hierarchy` data.
