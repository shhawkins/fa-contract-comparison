# Project Debrief - Contract Comparison App

**Date:** June 2nd, 2025
**Prepared By:** Gemini-Pro Assistant

## Current Project Status

The Contract Comparison App is in **Phase 7: Advanced PDF Parsing, Template Features, UI/UX Enhancements & Export Options**. Phases 0 through 6 are complete and considered production-ready.

The application allows flight attendants to compare their current employment contract with a new proposal. Key features already implemented include:
*   Dual contract display (responsive for desktop/mobile).
*   Pre-processed JSON data from PDFs with aviation-specific metadata.
*   Global search functionality across both contracts.
*   Category filtering.
*   PDF viewing in a modal with full navigation.
*   AI Chat integration (OpenAI GPT-4) for contract translation and queries.
*   Comprehensive aviation terms glossary.
*   Text selection and comparison tools with pre-built templates.
*   Shareable comparison outputs (image and text).
*   Advanced diff visualization between contract versions.
*   Enhanced responsive layout with multi-panel views.

## Phase 7 Focus Areas

The current development phase (Phase 7) is centered on the following objectives:

1.  **Advanced Hierarchical PDF Parsing & Structuring:**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the PDF pre-processing pipeline to accurately parse and structure contracts with multi-level hierarchies (e.g., Sections > Capital Letters > Numbers > Lowercase Letters, Letters of Agreement).
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A more granular and accurately nested JSON output, enabling more precise data analysis, navigation, and comparison, reflecting the true hierarchical nature of the contracts.

2.  **Advanced Template Features & Export Enhancements:**
    *   **Goal:** Implement advanced template features, including automated section finding and bulk comparison workflows.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** More powerful and efficient comparison capabilities for users, along with enhanced export options (e.g., PDF, structured data) and potential user account features for data persistence.

3.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   **Hierarchical Nesting and Display:** Improve the visual representation and user interaction with the hierarchically structured content that will result from the advanced PDF parsing. This includes ensuring intuitive navigation and clear presentation of nested items.
    *   **General UI Improvements:** Continuously refine the overall user interface based on feedback to ensure a polished, professional, and user-friendly experience.
    *   **Scrolling Behavior:** Fix the current scrolling issue. Each contract display (Document A, Document B) must scroll independently within its designated frame, preventing the entire webpage from scrolling. This is critical for usability.

## Key Technical Debt & Issues to Address

The following items are prioritized for resolution:

1.  **[HIGH PRIORITY] Directory Structure:** The development server currently needs to be run from a nested `/contract-chatbot/contract-chatbot/` directory. This needs to be fixed to allow `npm run dev` (or equivalent) from the root `contract-chatbot/` directory.
2.  **[NEW - MEDIUM PRIORITY] NPM Script "dev":** The `npm run dev` script is missing from `package.json`. This script needs to be added (e.g., `"dev": "next dev"`) to enable standard project startup.
3.  **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Documentation Updates:** The file structure section within `planning/SPEC_SHEET.md` needs to be updated to accurately reflect components from Phase 6 and any new components introduced in Phase 7.

## User Feedback Integration

The current plan for Phase 7 and the technical debt backlog directly incorporates recent user feedback regarding:
*   Improving/fixing hierarchical nesting and display (addressed in Phase 7 UI/UX Refinements).
*   Improving the overall UI (addressed in Phase 7 UI/UX Refinements).
*   Fixing frame/scrolling issues (addressed in Phase 7 UI/UX Refinements and noted as a key deliverable).

## Next Steps

*   Begin development work on Phase 7, prioritizing the advanced hierarchical PDF parsing.
*   Address the high-priority technical debt item related to the directory structure to streamline development.
*   Implement the `npm run dev` script.
*   Continuously update planning documents as Phase 7 progresses.
